# Contributions

Amplify Token is a tiny personal project built to aid a work project whereby generating user tokens was awkward for the backend team.
In the unlikely event anybody outside of the team finds the tool useful, there will no doubt be changes needed to make it as accessible and universal for as many people as possible. I am more than happy to extend the options, interactions and scope of the project and encourage submissions.
